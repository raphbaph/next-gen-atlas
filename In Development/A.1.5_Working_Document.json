AVCs represent the interests of MKR holders and MKR holders are of course interested in the economic management and governance of NEWDAO. But the organizing and expressing of MKR holder interests is intended to be first and foremost a cultural activity that gives life to intangible social value.\nCultural structures uniquely function by the logic of freedom. Cultural structures flourish the more that creative autonomy and robust competition are given free reign. AVCs are intended to impact the ecosystem not through issuing rigid mandates, but more so through the quality of their ideas - which, if sufficiently resonant and triumphant in the marketplace of ideas, are then taken up and actualized by the domain experts (Ecosystem Actors).",
